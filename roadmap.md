# Roadmap ArduPi

## Current STATUS

0.1
	- Schematic draft almost complete, need power managment and QC.
	- Need schematic review.
	- Selecting parts from JLCPCB
	- pcb layout
	- Need addition review.

## ArduPi-0.1	OPAL design reference.

- RPI-zero footprint.
- Standard IC's on board:
	- pca9685
	- ULN2803A
	- ADS1115
	- IMU9650
	- BMP280

## ArduPi-0.2	RP2040

- replace pca/ads/uln with RP2040. If this is indeed viable, enough channels etc.
- potental sensor upgrade, imu0650 is eol.

## ArduPi-0.3	CM4+radio

- RPI-Compute Module 4 carrier board.
- ExpressLRS Rx
- ADSB
- GPS

## ArduPi-Cube 
-Cube Orange carrier, for comparison and trialing against ArduPi.

## ArduPi-0.4	+Sensor 

- redundant sensors
- optical flow / lidar sensor
- airspeed sensor

## ArduPi-Dock

- Docking board(s) for individual vehicles with intergrated ESC / Power Connectors.
	- making ArduPi Pluggable into different vehicles.

## ArduPi-0.5	STM32

- RP2040 upgraded to STM32 allowing for full ardupilot redundancy between stm and rpi.
- +Sensor
- +Camera
